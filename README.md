# House-Price-Prediction

Repository Title: MLR House Price Prediction for India

Description:

This repository contains a Machine Learning project focused on predicting house prices in India using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) algorithm. Accurate property price estimation is crucial for both buyers and sellers, and this project aims to provide valuable insights into the Indian real estate market.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing steps to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Multiple Linear Regression: The MLR algorithm is implemented to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more.
Model Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using various evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
Visualization: Data visualization techniques are employed to present insights, relationships, and trends in the Indian housing market.
Deployment: The model can be deployed in real-world scenarios to assist homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
Dataset:
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset that includes property attributes, location data, and historical sale prices from various cities and regions across India.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (for code exploration)
Usage:

The Jupyter Notebook files guide users through data analysis, MLR model creation, and evaluation.
The trained model can be used for making price predictions for Indian houses.
